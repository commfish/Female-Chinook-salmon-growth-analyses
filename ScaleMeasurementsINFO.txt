The following are fields in ScaleMeasurements.csv, a datafile of salmon scale measurements. Each field’s name is followed by a colon and a description.

Name: Unique identifier for each scale image. There is only one image per fish and only one scale per image. All image names are 10 characters long. The first two characters are a "system code." System codes generally represent rivers in Alaska. The images have 13 river "system codes." The two character system codes in the image name are, AY = Andreafsky, BC = Kuskokwim, CP = Copper, CT = Chilkat, DC = Deshka, FY = Yukon, KN = Kenai (note that "SYSTEM CODE" further separates Kenai into early and late), KO = Kogrukluk, NC = Nushagak, SK = Stikine, TC = Taku, UK = Unalakleet, UU = Unuk. The second two characters are the final two numbers in the year the fish was sampled (e.g., 1973 = 73, and 2003 = 03). The fifth and sixth characters are fish age in European notation with no decimal (i.e., the number of years spent in fresh water after emergence from the gravel followed by the number of years spent in the ocean). The seventh character denotes the fish's sex (F = female, M = male, U = unknown). The 8-10th characters are a three character a number, assigned sequentially as the images were scanned (e.g., first image scanned was 001) for the system, year, fish age, and sex. Note that not all scale images were measured, so there are gaps in image numbering.

Year: Year that the scale was sampled from the fish.

BroodYear: The parental year for the fish, i.e. the calendar year when the parents spawned of the fish from which the scale was sampled.

SYS: Three-character system codes. AY = Andreafsky, BC = Kuskokwim, CP = Copper, CT = Chilkat, DC = Deshka, FY = Yukon, KE = Kenai early, KL = Kenai lake (note that all images have system code "KN" in their Name), KO = Kogrukluk, NC = Nushagak, SK = Stikine, TC = Taku, UK = Unalakleet, UU = Unuk.

Age: One character for year of life of the fish measured on a scale, values = 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. On the scale, 1 = freshwater growth (FW), 2 = first year at sea growth (SW1), 3 = second year at sea growth (SW2), 4 = third year at sea growth (SW3), 5 = fourth year at sea growth (SW4).

AdultAge: One character for age of fish at the time of scale sampling, including the year of life spent in the gravel (i.e., year of life spent in gravel plus the number of years spent as free-swimming fry in fresh water plus, number of years spent in the ocean).

Meas: Measurements, in millimeters, of scale growth to the nearest ten-thousandth of a millimeter. Measurements start at the middle of the focus of the scale and end at the fish’s final winter of growth. The measurements were from along the longest linear transect on the scale from the focus to the scale margin. Each value is a growth increment corresponds to the year of life that starts at scale formation (for freshwater growth) or at the end of winter growth (e.g., the second measurement starts at the end of the freshwater winter growth and ends at the next winter’s growth). Measurements were collected by sampling scales in the field by numerous Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADF&G) personnel throughout Alaska from the earliest available (as early as the 1960s but generally in the 1980s) through as late as 2015. Post-season, scales were pressed against a plastic acetate to form an impression and read for age by numerous ADF&G personnel. The age data was used by area ADF&G staff to inform population modeling and fisheries manangement. Acetates with scale impressions and biological and sampling data was reqeusted by the ADF&G MTA Lab, where an image of the impression was projected into a screen using a microfiche reader at 584 pixels/mm, and then an image was scanned of the projection with the image name proivded in the field "Name" (described above). The scales were measured using an Image Pro software macro produced by Media Cybernetics. Numerous ADF&G Fish and Wildlife Technicians and Fishery Bioloigsts scanned and measured scales at the ADF&G MTA Lab, with training provided by numerous personnel including Megan Lovejoy and Lorna Wilson. Data QA/QC, including testing for a reader effect for this project was performed primarly by Lorna Wilson.
